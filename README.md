## admin-bro-sequelizejs

This is an official [AdminBro](https://github.com/SoftwareBrothers/admin-bro) adapter which integrates [sequelize ORM](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/) into admin-bro.

## Usage

The plugin can be registered using standard `AdminBro.registerAdapter` method.

```javascript
const AdminBro = require('admin-bro')
const AdminBroSequelize = require('@admin-bro/sequelize')

AdminBro.registerAdapter(AdminBroSequelize)
```

More options can be found on [AdminBro](https://github.com/SoftwareBrothers/admin-bro) official website.

## Testing

Integration tests require running database. Database connection data are  given in `config/config.js`. Make sure you have following env variables set: POSTGRES_USER, POSTGRES_PASSWORD, POSTGRES_PORT, POSTGRES_DATABASE, POSTGRES_HOST. Take a look at `config/config.js` to see default values.


Than you will have to create database and run migrations

```
npm run sequelize db:create
npm run sequelize db:migrate
```
